This folder contains the php and HTML code to display the automatic Irish space weather monitor (CASE; Coras Aimsir Space na hEireann).

ALOT is still wrong with the files, from convention, to commenting, to their storage structure. Here, I will list a todo list of issues that arise as I identify them. This file is to help YOU, the future poor soul who's task it is to update or fix this station, or hopefully build upon it.

PHP file locations: /var/www/html/SWmonitor/
Python file locations: /home/tadhg/Documents/web_data/enlil_vid.py

Todo:

Comment PHP code
Reorganise storage system for data and html files
Update python code to flake8 standard with comments and convert to a series of functions instead of one block
Migrate python code to the same directory as the SWmonitor PHP scripts



This is all I can remember right now.

Good luck poor soul,
TG
